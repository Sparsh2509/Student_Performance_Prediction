# 📚 Student Performance Prediction API

A machine learning-powered web API using **FastAPI** to predict the **final grade (G3)** of students based on demographic, academic, family, and personal data. This project is based on the [UCI Student Performance Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance).

---

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts final student grade on a 0–20 scale.
- Organized input via four intuitive sections:
  - Student Details
  - Family Background
  - Academic Status
  - Health Status
- Categorical label encoding with automatic casing normalization.
- Grading remark generation (A+, B, C, etc.).
- Easy Flutter/mobile app integration.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.9+

### Setup:
```bash
# Clone repository and navigate
cd student_performance_prediction

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🏋️‍♂️ Model Training

To train or retrain the model using the dataset:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This will generate the model and encoder files:
- `student_performance_model.joblib`
- `label_encoders.joblib`

---

## 🚦 Running the API

Start the FastAPI server:
```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

Navigate to:
- Swagger Docs: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
- Root: [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)
